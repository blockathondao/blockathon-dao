# Blockathon Bounties
We might want to give guidance around minimum bounty prizes, maybe this is something we can finess once we have the dedicated partner telegram channel up and we got some responses from the workshop questionnaire.

## Suggestions
Typical bounties: 3 - 7 (depending on the tier of sponsorship)
Prize Range: $250 - $2000
$250 for a resource guide 
$1000 for a Dune Dashboard
$2000 for a PoC/MVP for an integration

## Submission
We can create a bitfwd Repo for the Blockathon
There we can accept PR’s from sponsors in separate README files

## BEST PRACTICES - ONLINE PRESENCE
We have seen the most value for both sponsors and participants when they are active in the Discord Channel + general wider community.
This does not require them to be on the Discord every hour but checking in a few times throughout the day and answering questions would be optimal.  
Your sponsor tag will be present on Discord to let people know that your project is being an active community member.
Let your own community members know that you are part of this event! By activating contributors who are already familiar and passionate about your brand, you can increase the quality of submissions. It is also an opportunity to strengthen those already existing relationships.



## BEST PRACTICES - THE BOUNTY DESCRIPTION
Being as specific as possible on what the task requires is very important. The more information written on the bounty will help with the eventual outcome for assessment. We have found that vague or too open-ended bounty descriptions attract a wide range of submission quality, which ends up not meeting project expectations.
A Loom video / recording describing the bounty and what you’re looking for would be really useful and have a nice personal touch to the bounty if possible.
Threads in your #sponsor channel are a great way to organize your bounties messages as people are interested in different fields of work. 
Make sure you’re setting your participants up for success! Please include links to your brand assets (logo, fonts, color palettes, brand guidelines, any marketing websites, etc.) with your bounty description.


## BEST PRACTICES - ENGAGEMENT
By participating in the calls, being responsive to any participant questions helps them feel supported and engaged with the company. 
This could lead to future contributions in your company at the end of the hackathon.
